## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Vercel hosting confirmed (static export incompatible with Server Actions)
- [Roadmap]: Brevo confirmed as email platform (only free tier with conditional automation)
- [Roadmap]: Phone field optional to reduce mobile form friction
- [Revision]: DNS/email auth deferred -- no domain purchased yet, moved to Phase 9
- [Revision]: Landing pages prioritised as Phases 2-5 before homepage and events
- [Revision]: Deploy to Vercel free tier with *.vercel.app URL (no custom domain yet)
- [Revision]: Privacy policy kept in Phase 1 (just a page, no domain needed)
- [Revision]: Email automation phases moved to end (Phases 9-10) pending domain purchase

### Pending Todos

None yet.

- Vercel Hobby plan commercial use classification needs confirmation with Devon/Southwest organizers
- Art of Living brand asset permissions not yet confirmed
