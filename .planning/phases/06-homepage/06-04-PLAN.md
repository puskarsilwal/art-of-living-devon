<objective>
Assemble the homepage page.tsx by importing all 5 section components built in Plans 02 and 03, then perform a human visual verification of the complete page.

Purpose: This is the integration step — wiring all the pieces together and confirming the page works end-to-end in the browser. The homepage must be accessible at the root URL with full branding, correct section order, and no runtime errors.

Output: A complete, live homepage at / that satisfies HOME-01 through HOME-04. Verified working by the user.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Assemble homepage page.tsx with all 5 sections</name>
  <files>src/app/(main)/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace the current 26-line placeholder `src/app/(main)/page.tsx` with the full assembled homepage. This is a pure server-component assembler — no client state, no logic, just imports and JSX composition.

Full replacement content:

```tsx
import type { Metadata } from "next"
import { HeroSection } from "@/components/home/hero-section"
import { OfferingsSection } from "@/components/home/offerings-section"
import { AboutSection } from "@/components/home/about-section"
import { LocalGuidesSection } from "@/components/home/local-guides-section"
import { FooterCta } from "@/components/home/footer-cta"

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  // Title omitted — root layout default "Art of Living Devon & Southwest" applies
  // (avoids "Art of Living Devon & Southwest | Art of Living Devon & Southwest" duplication)
  description:
    "Join free intro talks and meditation courses in Devon and Southwest England. Discover SKY Breath Meditation, pranayama, and yoga with certified Art of Living teachers.",
  robots: { index: true, follow: true },
}

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <HeroSection />
      <OfferingsSection />
      <AboutSection />
      <LocalGuidesSection />
      <FooterCta />
    </>
  )
}
```

Section order rationale (matches CONTEXT.md decisions):
1. HeroSection — full-bleed hero, primary CTA, establishes identity
2. OfferingsSection — three cards routing to all offerings (HOME-02)
3. AboutSection — credibility stats + mission (HOME-03)
4. LocalGuidesSection — local identity + teacher photo (HOME-04)
5. FooterCta — final conversion CTA to /intro

After writing the file, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
Build must succeed with zero errors. If there are TypeScript or import errors, fix them before moving to the checkpoint.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Visual verification of complete homepage</name>
  <what-built>
Complete homepage at / with:
- SiteHeader: sticky nav bar with logo, Intro Talk / Part 1 Course / Events links (desktop), Register Free CTA button
- HeroSection: full-bleed breathing-session.jpg background, dark gradient, Devon/Southwest headline, two CTAs
- OfferingsSection: three offering cards (Intro Talk, Part 1 Course, Community Events) with icons and CTA buttons
- AboutSection: 4-stat credibility grid (500M+, 180+, 100+, Yale & Harvard), mission statement, Gurudev mention
- LocalGuidesSection: teacher-guiding.jpg photo, "Your local guides" framing, Devon/Southwest local copy
- FooterCta: full-bleed orange section with white text and "Register for a Free Intro Talk" button
- SiteFooter: copyright, nav links (Intro Talk, Part 1 Course, Events), Privacy Policy
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run `npm run dev` and visit http://localhost:3000
2. Check the homepage renders without errors in the browser
3. Confirm the sticky header shows the logo, nav links, and Register Free button (desktop viewport)
4. Scroll through all 5 sections — hero, offerings, about, local guides, footer CTA
5. Click "Register for a Free Intro Talk" in hero — should navigate to /intro
6. Click "Explore Our Courses" in hero — should navigate to /happiness-program
7. Check the three offering cards link correctly: Intro Talk to /intro, Part 1 Course to /happiness-program
8. Community Events card links to /events — expect a 404 (this is correct; Phase 7 creates that route)
9. Confirm the brand color palette (white, orange primary) and peaceful imagery feel consistent with existing pages
10. Check on mobile viewport (375px): hero section is visible, offering cards stack vertically, nav links are hidden (expected)

`npm run build` succeeds. Homepage accessible at / in local dev server. All 5 sections visible. Nav links functional. Brand consistent with intro and course pages.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- src/app/(main)/page.tsx assembles all 5 sections with correct imports and section order
- `npm run build` passes with zero errors
- Homepage at / shows complete branded content: hero, offerings, about, local guides, footer CTA
- User approves the visual quality and brand consistency
- Community Events /events link gracefully 404s (expected behavior until Phase 7)
