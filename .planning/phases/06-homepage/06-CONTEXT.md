# Phase 6: Homepage - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Branded Art of Living Devon/Southwest homepage at the root URL — acts as the community hub that orients visitors and routes them to all offerings (intro talk, course page, events). Navigation elements, the About section, and links between pages are in scope. Individual page content and new page types are not.

## Implementation Decisions

### Claude's Discretion
User asked Claude to go ahead with the best approach for all areas. Decisions below represent the optimal implementation choices for this homepage.

### Hero & Above-Fold
- Full-width hero with a high-quality peaceful/meditation background image (Art of Living brand feel)
- Headline communicates community identity: Devon/Southwest Art of Living, serving local communities
- Primary CTA: "Register for a Free Intro Talk" — drives to the main conversion page (the highest-value action)
- Secondary CTA: "Explore Our Courses" — secondary option for visitors ready for more
- Navigation bar at top with logo and links to all key pages

### Navigation Hub Layout
- Three offering cards below the hero: Intro Talk, SKY Breathing & Meditation Course, Community Events
- Each card: icon or small image, short 1–2 line description, a clear CTA button
- Card layout conveys equal weight to all three offerings while giving each its own moment
- No dense nav-link lists — cards are more visually engaging and scannable

### Local Identity & Imagery
- Blend Art of Living brand colors (white, orange) with warm, human photography
- Include teacher/host section with photo, name, and a brief "Your local guides" framing
- Copy references Devon & Southwest communities to feel local and personal, not generic
- Peaceful, nature-adjacent imagery (not corporate) — consistent with existing pages

### About Section
- Medium depth: key credibility stats as a visual strip (500M+ people, 180 countries, 40+ years, Yale/Harvard research backing)
- One-sentence mission statement
- Brief Gurudev mention with name and title (photo optional)
- Kept concise — this is a hub page, visitors can learn more elsewhere

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- White and orange Art of Living brand palette, consistent with existing pages already built
- Teacher/host photo from the existing intro talk page can be reused for the "local guides" section
- Cards for the three offerings should feel scannable and action-oriented, not just descriptive

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- None — discussion stayed within phase scope
