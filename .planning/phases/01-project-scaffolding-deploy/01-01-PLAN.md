<objective>
Scaffold a Next.js 16 project with Tailwind CSS 4 and shadcn/ui, configure Art of Living brand theming, create the site shell (header/footer), build a UK GDPR/PECR compliant privacy policy page, and deploy to Vercel free tier.

Purpose: Establish the working foundation that all subsequent phases build on — a live, branded, deployable Next.js project with the required legal page.
Output: A public *.vercel.app URL serving a branded site with a privacy policy page.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Scaffold Next.js 16 project with Tailwind CSS 4, shadcn/ui, and Art of Living brand theming</name>
  <files>
    package.json
    src/app/globals.css
    src/app/layout.tsx
    src/app/page.tsx
    src/components/layout/site-header.tsx
    src/components/layout/site-footer.tsx
    components.json
  </files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Scaffold the project**
Run `npx create-next-app@latest . --yes` in the project directory. This gives Next.js 16 + Tailwind CSS 4 + TypeScript + App Router + Turbopack by default. Use `--yes` to accept all defaults.

Note: The project directory already exists with .planning/ files. Run create-next-app with `.` to scaffold into the current directory, or if it complains about a non-empty directory, scaffold into a temp directory and move files. Preserve the existing .planning/ directory.

**Step 2: Initialize shadcn/ui**
Run `npx shadcn@latest init` and configure:
- Style: New York
- Colors: OKLCH
- CSS variables: Yes

If the CLI prompts interactively, use `npx shadcn@latest init --defaults` or pass flags to avoid interactive prompts.

**Step 3: Configure Art of Living brand theme in globals.css**
Update `src/app/globals.css` with:
- `@import "tailwindcss"` (Tailwind v4 pattern — NOT the v3 `@tailwind` directives)
- Art of Living brand colors in OKLCH format:
  - Primary/brand orange: approximate `#F97316` in OKLCH (around `oklch(0.75 0.18 55)`) — this is the Art of Living signature orange
  - Clean white backgrounds
  - Warm gray for secondary surfaces (`oklch(0.96 0.01 80)`)
- Map brand orange as shadcn/ui `--primary` CSS variable
- Keep shadcn/ui's OKLCH variable structure intact
- DO NOT create a `tailwind.config.js` file (Tailwind v4 uses CSS-native config)

**Step 4: Configure typography via next/font**
In `src/app/layout.tsx`, load a clean sans-serif Google Font via `next/font/google` (Inter is a good default — clean, highly readable, works well for wellness/community sites). Apply as the body font class. This is within Claude's discretion per CONTEXT.md.

**Step 5: Create site shell components**
Create `src/components/layout/site-header.tsx`:
- Simple, clean header with "Art of Living Devon & Southwest" text/branding
- Mobile-responsive (hamburger menu not needed yet — just branding for now, navigation will grow in later phases)
- Use brand orange accent color

Create `src/components/layout/site-footer.tsx`:
- Footer with "Art of Living Devon & Southwest" attribution
- Link to /privacy-policy using Next.js Link component
- Copyright notice
- Keep minimal — will expand as pages are added

**Step 6: Update root layout**
Update `src/app/layout.tsx`:
- Import and render SiteHeader and SiteFooter
- Set `lang="en"` on html element
- Add metadata: title "Art of Living Devon & Southwest", description about free intro talks and meditation courses
- Add viewport config with themeColor set to brand orange
- Apply font class to body
- Body structure: `min-h-screen flex flex-col` with header, `flex-1` main, and footer

**Step 7: Create placeholder homepage**
Update `src/app/page.tsx` with a simple branded placeholder:
- "Art of Living Devon & Southwest" heading
- Brief welcome message
- Link to /privacy-policy
- This will be replaced in Phase 6

**Step 8: Verify build**
Run `npm run build` — must complete with zero errors.
  </action>
  <verify>
    <automated>npm run build 2>&1 | tail -20</automated>
    <manual>Check that globals.css uses @import "tailwindcss" (not @tailwind directives) and contains OKLCH brand color variables</manual>
  </verify>
  <done>Next.js 16 project builds with zero errors. shadcn/ui is initialized. Art of Living brand colors (orange primary, white, warm gray) are configured in OKLCH in globals.css. Site header and footer components exist and render in the root layout. Placeholder homepage shows branding.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create UK GDPR and PECR compliant privacy policy page</name>
  <files>
    src/app/privacy-policy/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
Create `src/app/privacy-policy/page.tsx` as a server component (no "use client" needed — this is static content).

**Page metadata:**
- Title: "Privacy Policy | Art of Living Devon & Southwest"
- Description: "How we collect, use, and protect your personal data."

**Page structure:**
Use Tailwind prose classes for readable typography: `container mx-auto max-w-3xl px-4 py-12 prose prose-neutral`

**Required sections (per 01-RESEARCH.md Privacy Policy Architecture and ICO guidance):**

1. **Who we are** — Art of Living Devon & Southwest community group. Note: Data controller identity. Provide a contact email placeholder (e.g., [email to be confirmed]) since domain is not yet purchased.

2. **What data we collect** — Name, email address, phone number (optional), website usage data (pages visited, time on site), cookie data. Make clear that phone is optional.

3. **Why we collect it (lawful basis)** — Three bases:
   - Consent: for marketing emails and tracking cookies
   - Legitimate interest: for event administration (sending Zoom links, reminders)
   - Note: consent checkboxes will be unticked by default per UK GDPR

4. **How we use your data** — Event registration processing, sending Zoom links and event reminders, follow-up communications about Art of Living courses, anonymous website analytics to improve the site.

5. **Third-party processors** — Name each explicitly:
   - **Brevo** (Sendinblue) — email automation, processes name and email, EU-based servers
   - **Meta (Facebook Pixel)** — conversion tracking for ad campaigns, US-based (adequate safeguards)
   - **Google Analytics 4** — anonymous usage analytics and UTM tracking, US-based (adequate safeguards)
   - **Vercel** — website hosting, processes server logs, US-based

6. **Cookies and tracking** — Table format listing:
   - Essential cookies (session, preferences) — no consent needed
   - Analytics cookies (Google Analytics) — require consent
   - Marketing cookies (Meta Pixel) — require consent
   - Note: tracking scripts will only load after explicit consent (implemented in Phase 8)

7. **Your rights under UK GDPR** — List all rights: access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, objection, right to withdraw consent, right to complain to the ICO.

8. **Data retention** — Registration data kept for 12 months after last activity. Analytics data retained per Google/Meta default retention periods. Users can request deletion at any time.

9. **International transfers** — Brevo processes data in the EU. Meta and Google are US-based; transfers rely on EU-US Data Privacy Framework / UK adequacy regulations and Standard Contractual Clauses.

10. **How to contact us** — Contact email placeholder. Include ICO complaint link: https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/

11. **Changes to this policy** — We will update this page and note the date of the last change.

**Tone:** Plain English per user decision. Short sentences. Clear headings. No Latin legal terms. Accessible to general audience.

**Last updated date:** Set to current date (2026-02-24).

Run `npm run build` after creating the page to verify it compiles.

  <verify>
    <automated>npm run build 2>&1 | tail -5</automated>
    <manual>Visit /privacy-policy in dev server and confirm all 11 sections are present, content is in plain English, and the page is readable on mobile</manual>
  </verify>
  <done>Privacy policy page exists at /privacy-policy with all 11 required sections covering UK GDPR and PECR requirements. Content names all four third-party processors (Brevo, Meta, Google, Vercel). Cookie table categorises cookies as essential, analytics, and marketing. Tone is plain English. Page builds without errors.</done>

  <files>
    .gitignore
    package.json
  </files>
  <action>
**Step 1: Initialize git repository**
Run `git init` if not already a git repo. Ensure .gitignore includes node_modules, .next, .env*.

**Step 2: Create GitHub repository**
Run `gh repo create art-of-living-devon --public --source=. --remote=origin` (or similar) to create a GitHub repo and set it as origin. If `gh` is not authenticated, this becomes a dynamic auth gate — pause and ask user to run `gh auth login`.

**Step 3: Commit and push**
Stage all project files (excluding .planning/ if desired, though it can be included). Commit with message "feat(01): scaffold Next.js 16 project with brand theming and privacy policy". Push to main.

**Step 4: Deploy to Vercel**
Run `npx vercel --yes` to deploy. If not authenticated, pause for user to run `npx vercel login`. After linking, run `npx vercel --prod --yes` for production deployment.

**Step 5: Record deployment URL**
Note the *.vercel.app URL for user verification.

**Step 6: Final build verification**
Run `npm run build` one final time to confirm zero errors.

**CHECKPOINT — After deployment, pause for human verification:**
