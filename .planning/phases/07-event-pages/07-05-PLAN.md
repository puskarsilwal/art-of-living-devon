  <name>Visual verification: Phase 7 event pages complete</name>
  <action>Start dev server and verify all routes, sections, CTAs, and form behavior described below. Fix any issues found before marking complete.</action>
  <what-built>
Complete Phase 7 event pages system:
- /events/satsang-2026-march — full event landing page (8 sections, no nav)
- /events — events index with event cards grid (with site header/footer)
- EventConfig data module driving both pages from a single data file
- Email opt-in form (stub, Brevo wired Phase 9) with GDPR consent
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Run the dev server: `npm run dev` in the project directory.

**Step 1: Events index (/events)**
Visit http://localhost:3000/events
- SiteHeader and SiteFooter should be visible
- At least 1 event card should appear (Satsang Evening)
- Card shows event image, date, time, location, price badge
- Click "View Details" — should navigate to the event detail page

**Step 2: Event detail page (/events/satsang-2026-march)**
Visit http://localhost:3000/events/satsang-2026-march
- NO site header or footer (standalone landing page)
- Section 1 (Hero): Full-bleed image with event name, date, "Register Now" button
- Section 2 (Details Bar): Dark strip with 4 icon tiles — Date / Time / Location / Price
- Section 3 (Experience): 2-column layout with pull quote and body copy
- Section 4 (Explainer): 3-feature icon grid explaining what Satsang is
- Section 5 (Video): NOT visible (no videoUrl set on sample event — correct)
- Section 6 (Social Proof): Styled text credibility logos + testimonial cards
- Section 7 (Email Opt-in): Form with Name, Email, GDPR checkbox, submit button
- Section 8 (Footer CTA): Orange background, white "Reserve Your Place" button

**Step 3: CTA verification**
- Click "Register Now" in the hero — should open https://www.artofliving.org/gb-en/events in a new tab
- Click "Reserve Your Place" in the footer — same external link, new tab

**Step 4: Email form**
- Submit the email form empty — should show field-level error messages
- Tick the consent checkbox and fill in name + email — submit
- Should show a green success message: "You're on the list! We'll send event updates to your inbox."
- No page reload (useActionState handles async state)

**Step 5: Invalid slug**
Visit http://localhost:3000/events/this-does-not-exist
- Should render the Next.js 404 page (not a crash)

**Step 6: Visual quality check**
The user asked for "dramatically better than current state — rich, immersive design."
Confirm the event page feels visually elevated: rich hero image with dark overlay, atmospheric mood, premium typography, cohesive spacing.
