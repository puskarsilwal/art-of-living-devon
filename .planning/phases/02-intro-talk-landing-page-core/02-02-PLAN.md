<objective>
Build the complete intro talk landing page with hero, benefits, social proof placeholder, registration form with GDPR consent, and 4 strategically placed CTAs.

Purpose: This is the core conversion page — the first thing Facebook ad visitors see. It must convert visitors into registrants within 30 seconds on mobile.

Output: A fully functional landing page at `/intro` with mobile-first responsive layout, working registration form, and 4 CTA placements.

  <name>Task 1: Create page section components and registration form</name>

    src/components/intro/hero-section.tsx
    src/components/intro/benefits-section.tsx
    src/components/intro/social-proof-section.tsx

  <action>
Create a reusable CTA component first. Either as a small helper within one of the files or as a shared piece — a simple anchor link wrapping a shadcn Button that scrolls to `#register`:
```tsx
<a href="#register">
  <Button size="lg" className="w-full sm:w-auto h-14 text-lg font-semibold px-8">
    Save My Seat — It's Free
  </Button>
</a>
```

**1. `src/components/intro/hero-section.tsx`** (Server Component):
- Import `nextIntroTalk` from `@/lib/data/intro-talks.ts`
- Import Badge from shadcn/ui
- Import Clock icon from lucide-react
- Layout (mobile-first):
  - `px-4 pt-8 pb-12 sm:pt-16 sm:pb-20 text-center` container
  - Badge: "Free Online Event" (secondary variant)
  - h1: Benefit-driven headline. Use: "Discover the Breath That Changes Everything" with "Changes Everything" in `text-primary` (orange). Mobile: `text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight`, desktop: `sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl`
  - Subheading: Brief value prop — "Join a free 60-minute intro to the Art of Living. Learn a powerful breathing technique used by millions worldwide." Use `text-muted-foreground text-base sm:text-lg max-w-xl mx-auto`
  - Date/time display: Flex row with Clock icon + `nextIntroTalk.date`, `nextIntroTalk.time`, `nextIntroTalk.timezone`. Styled as `text-lg font-medium`
  - **CTA #1**: Save My Seat anchor button (full-width on mobile, auto-width on sm+)
- CRITICAL: Keep hero content compact enough to fit above the fold on 375x667 viewport (iPhone SE). Headline max 2 lines on mobile, tight spacing.

**2. `src/components/intro/benefits-section.tsx`** (Server Component):
- Section with background contrast (e.g., `bg-muted/50` or light gray)
- Heading: "What You'll Experience" or similar
- 3-4 benefit items using a simple grid or list:
  - "Learn SKY Breath Meditation — a powerful technique backed by Yale and Harvard research"
  - "Simple practices for reducing stress, improving sleep, and boosting energy"
  - "Connect with a welcoming community in Devon & Southwest"
  - "Guided by an experienced Art of Living teacher"
- Each benefit: icon (CheckCircle or similar from lucide-react) + text
- **CTA #2**: Save My Seat anchor button after benefits list
- Mobile: single column. Desktop: 2-column grid for benefits.

**3. `src/components/intro/social-proof-section.tsx`** (Server Component):
- This is a PLACEHOLDER section for Phase 3 (which adds real testimonials, credibility stats, teacher profile)
- Show 2-3 placeholder elements that indicate social proof will go here:
  - A simple area with credibility stats: "180+ countries", "Millions of practitioners", "50+ years of impact" using large numbers + descriptions
  - Use Card components or a clean grid layout
- **CTA #3**: Save My Seat anchor button after social proof area
- Mark with a code comment: `{/* Phase 3 will add: testimonials, teacher profile, detailed credibility */}`

**4. `src/components/intro/registration-form.tsx`** (Client Component — "use client"):
- Import useActionState from "react"
- Import registerForIntroTalk and RegistrationState from `@/actions/register`
- Import shadcn/ui: Button, Input, Checkbox, Label
- Import Link from "next/link"
- Wrap in a section with `id="register"` and `className="scroll-mt-8"` for anchor scroll offset
- Form uses `action={formAction}` from useActionState (NOT onSubmit)
- Fields (all with `h-12 text-base` for touch-friendliness and iOS zoom prevention):
  - Name: `<Label htmlFor="name">Name *</Label>` + `<Input id="name" name="name" placeholder="Your full name" required className="h-12 text-base" />`
  - Email: `<Label htmlFor="email">Email *</Label>` + `<Input id="email" name="email" type="email" placeholder="your@email.com" required className="h-12 text-base" />`
  - Phone: `<Label htmlFor="phone">Phone <span className="text-muted-foreground">(optional)</span></Label>` + `<Input id="phone" name="phone" type="tel" placeholder="07xxx xxxxxx" className="h-12 text-base" />`
- GDPR Consent: `<Checkbox id="consent" name="consent" required />` with label: "I agree to receive event details and reminders by email. See our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)." The checkbox MUST be unticked by default (no `defaultChecked`). Privacy policy link opens in new tab (`target="_blank"`).
- Submit button: `<Button type="submit" size="lg" className="w-full h-14 text-lg font-semibold" disabled={pending}>` with text "Save My Seat" (shows "Saving your seat..." when pending)
- Display server response message below button with `aria-live="polite"` — green for success, destructive for errors
- Display field-level errors from `state.errors` if present, below each respective field
- Wrap the form in a Card component for visual containment with heading "Reserve Your Free Seat"

**5. `src/components/intro/footer-cta.tsx`** (Server Component):
- Final call-to-action section before page ends
- Background: primary/orange tinted or contrasting section
- Text: "Ready to transform your life?" or "Don't miss out — seats are limited"
- **CTA #4**: Save My Seat anchor button (could use outline variant for visual variety)

**6. `src/app/(landing)/intro/page.tsx`** (Server Component):
- Set page metadata: `title: "Free Intro Talk — Art of Living Devon & Southwest"`, `description: "Join a free 60-minute online intro..."`
- Import and render all sections in order:
  1. HeroSection
  2. BenefitsSection
  3. SocialProofSection
  4. Registration section (with RegistrationForm wrapped in appropriate container)
  5. FooterCTA
- Add `scroll-behavior: smooth` — either in globals.css (`html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }`) or on the html element. Check if it's already in globals.css first.
- Ensure the page has no horizontal overflow on mobile — no element should break the viewport width.

**Mobile-first guidelines (apply to ALL components):**
- Base styles are for mobile (375px). Use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` for larger screens.
- Section padding: `px-4 py-12` base, `sm:px-6 sm:py-16 lg:py-20` expanded
- Container: `max-w-4xl mx-auto` or similar to constrain content width on desktop
- Buttons: `w-full sm:w-auto` (full-width on mobile, auto on desktop)
- Text: body text `text-base` (16px min), headings scale up with breakpoints
- All interactive elements: minimum 44px height for touch targets

  <name>Task 2: Verify intro talk landing page on mobile and desktop</name>
  <files>src/app/(landing)/intro/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Human verification checkpoint. Claude has built the complete intro talk landing page. The user must visually verify the page on mobile and desktop viewports.

What was built: Complete intro talk landing page at /intro with hero section (headline + date/time + CTA), benefits section + CTA, social proof placeholder + CTA, registration form with GDPR consent, and footer CTA. Mobile-first responsive layout with no navigation distractions.

How to verify:
1. Run `npm run dev` and visit http://localhost:3000/intro
2. Open Chrome DevTools → Toggle Device Toolbar → Select iPhone SE (375x667)
3. Verify above-the-fold: headline, date/time, and first "Save My Seat" button are visible without scrolling
4. Scroll down: confirm 4 total "Save My Seat" CTAs (hero, after benefits, after social proof, footer)
5. Click any "Save My Seat" CTA — page should smooth-scroll to the registration form
6. Verify form fields: Name *, Email *, Phone (optional), GDPR checkbox (unticked by default)
7. Verify the privacy policy link opens /privacy-policy in a new tab
8. Submit the form with valid data — should show success message
9. Submit with empty fields — should show validation errors
10. Switch to desktop viewport (1280px+) — layout should expand nicely
11. Visit http://localhost:3000/ — homepage should still show header and footer
12. Visit http://localhost:3000/privacy-policy — should still show header and footer
  </action>
  <verify>User confirms the page renders correctly on mobile and desktop, form works, 4 CTAs present, GDPR checkbox unticked by default</verify>
  <done>User has approved the intro talk landing page visual design, mobile responsiveness, form functionality, and CTA placement. Type "approved" or describe issues to fix.</done>
</task>
