<objective>
Human verification of the complete Phase 4 registration flow across all three features: countdown timer, session picker, and confirmation page.

Purpose: Visual and functional verification cannot be automated. This checkpoint confirms the end-to-end experience feels right — session picker is scannable and easy to use on mobile, countdown timer creates appropriate urgency, confirmation page is calm and focused.

Output: Approval to mark Phase 4 complete.

Run the production build to confirm all Phase 4 code compiles cleanly:

```bash
cd "/Users/mac/Documents/Art of Living Landing Page" && npm run build
```

Confirm build exits with code 0 and no TypeScript or compilation errors. Report the last 10 lines of build output so the human can see the result before testing.

      1. COUNTDOWN TIMER (INTRO-11)
         Visit http://localhost:3000/intro
         Hero section shows "Next session in" countdown with ticking seconds
         No hydration errors in browser console

      2. SESSION PICKER (INTRO-12)
         Scroll to registration form
         3 session cards appear above the form ("Choose your session")
         Desktop: cards in a row; mobile (375px): cards stacked
         Clicking a card highlights it with primary border + checkmark
         Clicking another card moves selection

      3. FULL REGISTRATION FLOW (INTRO-10)
         Select a session, fill form (Name, Email, GDPR checkbox), submit
         Page navigates to /intro/confirmation?session=...
         Confirmation page shows "You're registered!" heading
         Session date/time matches selection
         "Join Zoom" button is large and prominent
         "Google Calendar" and "Download .ics" buttons appear side-by-side
         Clicking "Download .ics" triggers a file download
         Clicking "Add to Google Calendar" opens Google Calendar with pre-filled event
         No header or footer on the confirmation page

      4. ERROR HANDLING
         Visit http://localhost:3000/intro/confirmation?session=invalid
