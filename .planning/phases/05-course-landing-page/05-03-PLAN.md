<objective>
Build three middle sections of the Happiness Program page: Course Content (what you'll learn), Upcoming Dates (local Devon courses with Register Now CTAs), and Founder (Sri Sri Ravi Shankar with Gurudev quote).

Purpose: These sections answer the key pre-purchase questions — what happens in the course, when can I join, and who is behind it?
Output: 3 Server Component files in src/components/course/ covering COURSE-02 and COURSE-04.

  <name>Task 1: Course content section + Founder section</name>
  <files>
    src/components/course/course-content-section.tsx
    src/components/course/founder-section.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**src/components/course/course-content-section.tsx**
"What You'll Learn" section. No data import — all content is static copy in the component.

Section header: "What You'll Learn in 3 Days"
Sub-header: "3 sessions × 3 hours — a complete transformation toolkit"

Display 4 learning modules as cards. Use Card component from shadcn/ui. Grid: 1 col on mobile, 2 cols on md+. Each card has an icon (from lucide-react), bold title, and 2-3 line description:

1. **Sudarshan Kriya (SKY Breath)** — Wind icon (or Waves icon)
   "The signature Art of Living breathing technique. Clinically researched rhythm of breath that releases stress at the cellular level."

2. **Pranayama (Breathing Exercises)** — Activity icon (or Heart icon)
   "Ancient yogic breathing practices to energize, calm, and balance the nervous system. Includes Bhastrika, Ujjayi, and Nadi Shodhana."

3. **Yoga & Meditation** — Sun icon (or Star icon)
   "Gentle yoga sequences combined with guided meditation to quiet the mind and re-energize the body. No prior yoga experience needed."

4. **Wisdom for Daily Life** — Lightbulb icon (or BookOpen icon)
   "Interactive sessions on practical tools for handling everyday challenges — relationships, emotions, and finding inner peace."

Below the grid, add a single CTA: "Register Now" external link to https://www.artofliving.org/gb-en/courses/art-of-living-part-one (target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"), centered.

Use OKLCH color variables (text-primary, bg-muted/30) — not hardcoded hex.

**src/components/course/founder-section.tsx**
Section on Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. Per the research pitfall notes: no Gurudev portrait photo exists in the assets — use AboutArtOfLiving.webp as an ambient large image (a crowd/event photo), and feature the quote prominently.

Structure (2-column on lg+, stacked on mobile):
- Left column: `next/image` showing `/images/course/about-art-of-living.webp` (or fallback to `/images/intro/about-art-of-living.webp` if course version was not copied) — use `width={600} height={400}` with `className="rounded-xl object-cover w-full"`
- Right column:
  - Small badge: "About the Founder"
  - H2: "Sri Sri Ravi Shankar"
  - Short bio (3-4 sentences): "Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is a humanitarian, spiritual leader, and founder of the Art of Living Foundation. In 1982, he developed Sudarshan Kriya — a powerful breathing technique that has since helped over 800 million people in 180 countries reduce stress, improve sleep, and find inner peace. He teaches that peace begins within each of us."
  - Blockquote with the Gurudev quote (per CONTEXT.md): "The quality of our lives depends on the quality of our minds." — Sri Sri Ravi Shankar
  - Style the blockquote: left border in `border-l-4 border-primary`, italic, generous padding, slightly larger text

TODO comment at top of component: "// TODO: Replace about-art-of-living.webp with Gurudev portrait photo when available"

  <action>
**src/components/course/upcoming-dates-section.tsx**
The conversion section — 3 course listing cards, each with a Register Now CTA.

Add section anchor: `<section id="upcoming-dates" ...>` so the "View Upcoming Dates" CTA in ProgramOverviewSection can scroll to it.

Structure:
- Section header: "Upcoming Devon & Southwest Courses"
- Sub-header: "Choose a format and location that works for you"
- Import `courseDates` from `@/lib/data/course-dates` and `CourseDate` type
- Import `Badge` from `@/components/ui/badge`, `Button` from `@/components/ui/button`, `Card CardContent` from `@/components/ui/card`
- Grid: 1 col on mobile, sm:grid-cols-2, lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4

Each card (per the RESEARCH.md upcoming dates card pattern):
```typescript
<Card className="hover:shadow-md transition-shadow">
  <CardContent className="p-5">
    <div className="flex items-start justify-between gap-4 mb-4">
      <div>
        <p className="font-semibold text-base">{course.startDate} – {course.endDate}</p>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-0.5">{course.location}</p>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">{course.time} {course.timezone}</p>
      </div>
      <Badge variant="secondary">{course.format}</Badge>
    </div>
    {course.badge && (
      <p className="text-xs font-medium text-primary mb-3">{course.badge}</p>
    )}
    <a href={course.registrationUrl} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="block">
      <Button className="w-full">Register Now</Button>
    </a>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

Below the cards grid, add a small note: "Can't find a date that works? View all available courses at artofliving.org/gb-en" with the artofliving.org link.

The `registrationUrl` from course-dates.ts drives all CTAs — this is the single source of truth (no hardcoded URLs in the component). This satisfies COURSE-04.

  <done>upcoming-dates-section.tsx exists, compiles, and has id="upcoming-dates" on the section. Register Now CTAs use course.registrationUrl. Component renders 3 date cards from the data module.</done>

After all tasks:
1. `npx tsc --noEmit` — no errors in course/course-content-section.tsx, course/upcoming-dates-section.tsx, course/founder-section.tsx
2. grep upcoming-dates src/components/course/upcoming-dates-section.tsx — section id exists
3. grep registrationUrl src/components/course/upcoming-dates-section.tsx — data-driven CTA confirmed
4. npm run build — exits 0
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- 3 Server Component files exist in src/components/course/
- Upcoming dates section has id="upcoming-dates" for scroll targeting
- All Register Now CTAs use course.registrationUrl (data-driven, not hardcoded)
- Founder section has Gurudev blockquote and uses ambient image
- npm run build exits 0
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-course-landing-page/05-03-SUMMARY.md`
