<objective>
Build the remaining three content sections — teacher profile, what-to-expect breakdown, and objection handling — then compose all Phase 3 sections into the intro page in the correct order. This completes the trust-building content layer.

Purpose: These sections reduce uncertainty (what-to-expect), build human connection (teacher profile), and remove final barriers (objections) for cold traffic considering registration.
Output: Three new section components, one data file, and an updated page.tsx with the full section composition.

  <name>Task 1: Create teacher profile, what-to-expect, and objections section components</name>
  <files>

  </files>
  <action>
**What-to-expect data file:**

1. Create `src/lib/data/what-to-expect.ts`:
   - Export a `Step` type: `{ number: number; title: string; description: string; outcome: string; duration: string; iconName: string }`
   - Export `whatToExpectSteps` array with 6 steps from RESEARCH.md findings:
     1. Welcome & Introduction (~5 min) — "Setting the space" / outcome: "Feel welcomed and at ease"
     2. Understanding the Mind (~10 min) — "Interactive talk on how thoughts create stress" / outcome: "Fresh perspective on your own mind"
     3. Breathing Technique (~15 min) — "Guided calming breathing exercise" / outcome: "Feel your body and mind begin to settle"
     4. Guided Meditation (~15 min) — "Real meditation experience, effortless" / outcome: "Feel light, calm, and at peace"
     5. Community Connection (~5 min) — "Connect with like-minded people" / outcome: "Sense of belonging"
     6. Q&A + Next Steps (~10 min) — "Live questions with the teacher" / outcome: "Clarity on your journey forward"

**Teacher section:**

2. Create `src/components/intro/teacher-section.tsx`:
   - Import `Image` from `next/image`, icons from lucide-react (`Award`, `Heart`, `Users`, `Sparkles`)
   - Section heading: "Your Guide" or "Meet Your Guide"
   - Layout: flex-col on mobile, md:flex-row with image on one side and text on other
   - **Image:** Use `next/image` with a placeholder path `/images/intro/teacher-guiding-placeholder.jpg`. Since no actual image exists yet, use a styled div placeholder with a lucide icon (e.g. `Users` or `Heart`) and a subtle gradient background as the image stand-in. Add a code comment: `{/* TODO: Replace with actual teacher-in-action photo */}`
   - **Content:**
     - "Certified Art of Living Teacher" as subtitle
     - "Trained personally in the tradition of Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar" — credential
     - "Passionate about sharing these life-changing techniques with your local Devon & Southwest community" — warmth/approachability
     - 2-3 credential badges using lucide icons: Award ("Internationally certified"), Heart ("Warm, supportive approach"), Users ("Part of your local community")
   - Do NOT use a specific named teacher (locked decision)
   - Follow section spacing: `px-4 py-12 sm:px-6 sm:py-16 lg:py-20`, `max-w-4xl mx-auto`
   - Use `bg-muted/50` for alternating rhythm if appropriate

**What-to-expect section:**

3. Create `src/components/intro/what-to-expect-section.tsx`:
   - Import steps data from `@/lib/data/what-to-expect.ts`
   - Import relevant lucide icons for each step (e.g. `Handshake`, `Brain`, `Wind`, `Sunrise`, `Users`, `MessageCircle`)
   - Section heading: "What to Expect in 60 Minutes" or similar
   - Render as a vertical timeline or numbered step cards:
     - Each step shows: number badge (bg-primary text-white rounded-full), icon, title, duration badge, description, and outcome in italics or muted accent
     - Show both practical description AND experiential outcome (locked decision: "what happens" + "what you'll feel")
   - Mobile-first: single column, generous spacing between steps
   - Visual richness: icons for each step, duration badges, clear visual progression
   - Follow section spacing conventions

**Objections section:**

4. Create `src/components/intro/objections-section.tsx`:
   - Import icons from lucide-react: `UserCheck`, `CreditCard`, `Camera`, `Clock`, `Wifi`, `Users`
   - Section heading: "Everything You Need to Know" or "No Barriers, Just Benefits" or similar welcoming tone
   - Define 6 objections inline (no separate data file — small enough):
     - UserCheck: "No experience needed"
     - CreditCard: "100% free, no credit card"
     - Camera: "Camera optional, no pressure"
     - Clock: "Just 60 minutes of your time"
     - Wifi: "Join from anywhere with internet"
     - Users: "Guided by a live, certified teacher"
   - Render as icon badge grid: 2 columns on mobile, 3 columns on `sm:`
   - Each badge: icon (h-10 w-10, text-primary, bg-primary/10 rounded-full), text below
   - Generous padding, centered text, visually clean
   - Include CTA button after objections: "Save My Seat — It's Free" linking to #register
   - Follow section spacing conventions

  <name>Task 2: Compose all sections into intro page in trust-building order</name>
  <files>
    src/app/(landing)/intro/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
Update `src/app/(landing)/intro/page.tsx` to compose all sections in the recommended trust-building order:

1. Remove the import for `SocialProofSection`
2. Add imports for all new Phase 3 components:
   - `CredibilitySection` from `@/components/intro/credibility-section`
   - `TestimonialsSection` from `@/components/intro/testimonials-section`
   - `WhatToExpectSection` from `@/components/intro/what-to-expect-section`
   - `TeacherSection` from `@/components/intro/teacher-section`
   - `ObjectionsSection` from `@/components/intro/objections-section`

3. Update the section order in the JSX to follow the trust-building funnel:
   ```
   <HeroSection />
   <BenefitsSection />
   <CredibilitySection />          {/* Quick trust signal — stats + research */}
   <TestimonialsSection />          {/* Deeper trust — real people */}
   <WhatToExpectSection />          {/* Reduce uncertainty — what happens */}
   <TeacherSection />               {/* Human connection — your guide */}
   <ObjectionsSection />            {/* Remove final barriers */}
   <RegistrationForm />
   <FooterCTA />
   ```

4. Rationale for order (document in a code comment):
   - Credibility first: quick stats convince they're legit
   - Testimonials second: real people confirm it works
   - What-to-expect third: reduce uncertainty about the session
   - Teacher fourth: human connection before asking for registration
   - Objections fifth: remove last barriers right before the form

5. Run `npm run build` to confirm the full page compiles and renders.

    <automated>cd "/Users/mac/Documents/Art of Living Landing Page" && npm run build 2>&1 | tail -20</automated>
    <manual>Visit /intro page — all sections visible in correct order, no duplicate stats, visual flow is cohesive</manual>
  </verify>
  <done>Intro page composes all 9 sections in trust-building order. No duplicate stats (old SocialProofSection replaced). Build succeeds with zero errors. Page is ready for visual verification.</done>
</task>

- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
- `npm run build` completes successfully
- All 5 new section components render on the /intro page
- Section order follows trust-building funnel: Hero > Benefits > Credibility > Testimonials > WhatToExpect > Teacher > Objections > RegistrationForm > FooterCTA
- No duplicate stats from old SocialProofSection
- All sections are mobile-first responsive
- Teacher section uses generic profile (no specific named teacher)
- Objections section addresses all 3 required objections plus additional ones
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. TeacherSection renders generic teacher profile with credentials + warmth (no named teacher)
2. WhatToExpectSection shows 6 steps with practical description AND experiential outcome
3. ObjectionsSection addresses 6 objections including the 3 required ones
4. page.tsx composes all 9 sections in trust-building order
5. No duplicate content from old placeholder SocialProofSection
6. Full build passes with zero errors
7. All sections follow existing mobile-first spacing conventions
