# Phase 3: Intro Talk Landing Page - Trust & Content - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Add trust-building and content sections to the existing intro talk landing page so cold Facebook ad traffic feels confident registering for an event from an organization they've never heard of. Covers: social proof/testimonials, credibility stats, teacher profile, what-to-expect breakdown, and objection handling. All sections integrate into the existing `/intro` page built in Phase 2.

## Implementation Decisions

### Testimonials & Social Proof
- Source real testimonials from existing Art of Living participants (publicly available)
- Supplement with local Devon/Southwest testimonials if available
- No sourcing constraints — plenty of material exists

### Credibility Stats
- Display Yale/Harvard research, 500M+ lives, 180 countries stats
- Stats should be visually prominent to build trust with cold traffic

### Teacher Profile
- Do NOT feature a specific named teacher — keep it generic ("certified Art of Living teachers")
- Balance credentials (trained by Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, certified by Art of Living Foundation) with warmth/approachability (friendly local community, here to guide you)
- Include an image of a teacher in action (teaching/guiding a session) — source appropriate imagery, can be placeholder to swap later

### What to Expect
- Research the standard Art of Living intro talk format (Claude to investigate)
- Show both practical steps (what happens) AND experiential outcomes (what you'll feel)
- Level of detail (exact timings vs general flow) is Claude's discretion

### Objection Handling
- Start with the three listed: "No experience needed", "Free, no credit card required", "Camera optional"
- Research additional common objections for online meditation/wellness intro sessions (Claude to investigate)

### Claude's Discretion
- Testimonial layout format (cards, carousel, grid — whatever works best for mobile-first cold traffic)
- Number of testimonials to show
- Credibility stats visual treatment (banner, woven into sections, etc.)
- Objection handling visual format (icon badges, FAQ accordion, etc.)
- Objection placement strategy (dedicated section, near CTAs, or both)
- What-to-expect detail level and visual style
- Loading states and error handling
- All spacing, typography, and responsive behavior

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- User prioritises visually elevated design — stunning photos, meaningful icons, rich visuals over text-heavy layouts
- Teacher image should depict someone actively teaching/guiding, not a headshot
- Testimonials are abundant — this is not a content sourcing problem, it's a presentation problem
