<objective>
Visually overhaul all 5 Phase 3 section components to address the user's feedback: "too text heavy", "doesn't spark anything", "not professional", "icons aren't aligning", "testimonials feel fake without photos", "teacher placeholder looks broken."

Purpose: Transform the intro page from a basic text template into a premium, visually rich landing page that builds trust with cold Facebook ad traffic. This is the most impactful gap closure — every section gets elevated.

Output: 5 rewritten section components with real photos, fixed alignment, premium card treatments, and visual variety between sections.

    **Testimonials Section (`testimonials-section.tsx`) — Full rewrite:**

    Replace the letter-initial avatar circles with real photos using `next/image`:
    ```typescript
    import Image from "next/image"
    ```

    For each testimonial card:
    - Replace the `div.h-10.w-10.rounded-full.bg-primary/10` avatar with:
      ```tsx
      <Image
        src={testimonial.imagePath}
        alt={testimonial.name}
        width={48}
        height={48}
        className="rounded-full object-cover h-12 w-12"
      />
      ```
    - Add the `highlight` field as a visually prominent pull-quote above the full quote (larger font, text-primary, or bold treatment)
    - Upgrade card styling: add `border-0 shadow-md hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow` for premium feel
    - Add subtle gradient or warm background tint to alternate cards for visual variety
    - Make the Quote icon more decorative: position it as a large watermark behind the text (absolute positioned, larger size like h-16 w-16, very low opacity like text-primary/10)
    - Keep the 2-column grid on md+ but ensure cards have equal height

    **Section header enhancement:**
    - Add a subtle decorative element above the heading (small horizontal line or dot accent in primary color)
    - Add a subtitle/description line: "Real experiences from people just like you" in text-muted-foreground

    **Credibility Section (`credibility-section.tsx`) — Visual elevation:**

    Elevate the stats cards from basic boxes to premium treatment:
    - Add gradient border or subtle gradient background to each stat card (e.g., `bg-gradient-to-b from-background to-primary/5`)
    - Make stat numbers even larger on desktop: `text-4xl sm:text-5xl` (currently text-3xl sm:text-4xl)
    - Add a subtle decorative ring or glow effect behind the icon circle
    - Give each stat card a slight hover transform: `hover:scale-105 transition-transform`

    Research highlights elevation:
    - Add a subtle background gradient to the research highlights area
    - Make the institution badge more prominent with a border treatment
    - Ensure the FlaskConical icon aligns perfectly with the first line of text (use `items-center` or manual adjustment)

    Both sections: maintain existing padding pattern (`px-4 py-12 sm:px-6 sm:py-16 lg:py-20`), `max-w-4xl mx-auto`, and alternating `bg-muted/50` backgrounds. Keep all CTA buttons as-is.

  <name>Task 2: Overhaul teacher, what-to-expect, and objections sections with photo + alignment fixes</name>

  <action>
    **Teacher Section (`teacher-section.tsx`) — Replace placeholder with real photo:**

    Replace the gradient placeholder div (lines 28-34) with a real image:
    ```tsx
    import Image from "next/image"

    <Image
      src="/images/intro/teacher-guiding.jpg"
      alt="Art of Living teacher guiding a breathing and meditation session"
      width={600}
      height={400}
      className="rounded-2xl object-cover w-full aspect-[4/3]"
      priority={false}
    />
    ```

    Additional teacher section enhancements:
    - Add a subtle shadow to the image: `shadow-lg`
    - The credential badges (Award, Heart, Users) need proper vertical alignment: ensure `items-center` is used in the flex container, and the icon circle and text label are perfectly centered vertically
    - Add a warm background tint to the text side or a decorative quote from Gurudev
    - Consider adding a subtle background pattern or gradient to the section

    **What-to-Expect Section (`what-to-expect-section.tsx`) — Polish the timeline:**

    Fix alignment issues in the step items:
    - The icon, title, and duration badge in the flex-wrap row (line 52-62) need consistent vertical centering: use `items-center` explicitly and ensure the Badge doesn't shift baseline
    - Make the numbered circles slightly larger for better visual weight: `h-14 w-14` (currently h-12 w-12) with `text-xl` (currently text-lg)
    - Add a subtle card/background treatment to each step for visual containment: wrap each step in a rounded container with `bg-background rounded-xl p-4 shadow-sm` (similar treatment to credibility cards)
    - The connecting line between steps should be a gradient from primary to primary/20 rather than plain `bg-border`
    - Add the lifestyle image `breathing-session.jpg` as a decorative element — either as a background image with overlay at the top of the section, or as a small accent image beside the header

    **Objections Section (`objections-section.tsx`) — Fix alignment + elevate:**

    Fix the icon + text alignment (Gap 3):
    - The current layout has icon circle above text in a `flex-col items-center` stack. This is fine for centered layout but the vertical gap between icon and text is inconsistent
    - Ensure consistent gap: use `gap-2` (not gap-3) for tighter coupling of icon to its label
    - Make the icon circles larger: `h-16 w-16` with `h-8 w-8` icons (currently h-14 w-14 with h-7 w-7)
    - Add a subtle card background to each objection item: `bg-muted/30 rounded-xl p-4 sm:p-6` for visual containment
    - Add a checkmark or verified badge accent to reinforce "these are guarantees"
    - Consider adding a warm header with icon: a Shield or CheckCircle before the heading

    All three sections: maintain existing padding pattern, max-w container, and section flow. Keep all CTA buttons unchanged. Ensure `npm run build` succeeds.
