# Plan 03-11: Remove TeacherSection + Fix AboutSection Alignment + Consistent CTAs

## Goal

Remove the redundant "Meet Your Guide" section (no named teacher, covered by AboutSection) and fix the AboutSection stats tile grid overflow caused by `sm:grid-cols-4` inside a half-width column.

## Context

**Why remove TeacherSection:** The section only says "Certified Art of Living Teacher" with no real name or personal bio. The AboutSection already covers organizational trust ("40 Years", Gurudev founding, 500M+ lives). Without a specific teacher name, TeacherSection adds generic filler rather than genuine trust.

**Why the stats overflow:** `about-section.tsx` uses `grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4 gap-4` for the 4 stat tiles. At `sm` (640px+), the outer layout is still a single column (`lg:grid-cols-2` means the 2-column split only starts at 1024px). So at 640–1023px, the 4-column stat grid tries to render at full viewport width — fine. But at 1024px+ (when the outer grid IS 2-column), the left text column is ~50% wide and `sm:grid-cols-4` is already active, forcing 4 tiles in a narrow space. Fix: use `grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4` so the 4-wide layout only activates when the outer layout also goes 2-column.

## Tasks

<tasks>

<task id="1" title="Remove TeacherSection from page.tsx">
Open `src/app/(landing)/intro/page.tsx`.

Remove:
1. The import line: `import { TeacherSection } from "@/components/intro/teacher-section"`
2. The JSX render: `<TeacherSection />`
3. Update the inline comment numbering so it stays accurate (Teacher was #8, About becomes #8, Objections #9, etc.)

The section order after removal:
1. HeroSection
2. SessionIntroSection
3. BenefitsSection
4. CredibilitySection
5. MediaLogosSection
6. TestimonialsSection
7. WhatToExpectSection
8. AboutSection
9. ObjectionsSection
10. RegistrationForm
11. FooterCTA
</task>

<task id="2" title="Delete teacher-section.tsx">
Delete the file `src/components/intro/teacher-section.tsx`.

This file is no longer imported anywhere after task 1.
</task>

<task id="3" title="Fix AboutSection stats grid alignment">
Open `src/components/intro/about-section.tsx`.

Find this line in the organization facts grid:
```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
```

Replace with:
```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
```

This ensures the 4-column layout only activates at `lg` (1024px) — the same breakpoint at which the outer 2-column layout activates — preventing overflow at tablet widths.
</task>

<task id="4" title="Fix CredibilitySection CTA for consistency">
Open `src/components/intro/credibility-section.tsx`.

The current CTA is a raw `<button>` with different copy from every other CTA on the page:
```tsx
<div className="mt-8">
  <a href="#register">
    <button className="w-full sm:w-auto px-8 h-12 rounded-lg bg-primary text-primary-foreground font-semibold text-base hover:bg-primary/90 transition-colors">
      Experience It For Free
    </button>
  </a>
</div>
```

Replace with the shadcn `Button` component matching every other CTA on the page.

First, add the Button import at the top of the file (after the existing imports):
```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
```

Then replace the CTA block with:
```tsx
<div className="mt-8">
  <a href="#register">
    <Button
      size="lg"
      className="w-full sm:w-auto h-12 text-base font-semibold px-8"
    >
      Save My Seat (It&apos;s Free)
    </Button>
  </a>
</div>
```

This makes the copy and component consistent with the CTAs in BenefitsSection, TestimonialsSection, and ObjectionsSection.
</task>

<task id="5" title="Verify TypeScript compiles">
Run: `npx tsc --noEmit`

Expected: zero output, zero errors.

If errors appear related to the deleted teacher-section.tsx import, ensure task 1 fully removed the import from page.tsx.
</task>

</tasks>

## Verification Criteria

- `src/components/intro/teacher-section.tsx` does not exist
- `src/app/(landing)/intro/page.tsx` has no `TeacherSection` import
- `src/app/(landing)/intro/page.tsx` has no `<TeacherSection />` JSX
- `src/components/intro/about-section.tsx` contains `grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4` (not `sm:grid-cols-4`)
- `src/components/intro/credibility-section.tsx` imports `Button` from `@/components/ui/button`
- `src/components/intro/credibility-section.tsx` CTA reads `Save My Seat (It&apos;s Free)` (no raw `<button>` element)
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors
- Page renders 11 sections (not 12)
