<objective>
Remove all em-dashes from hero, session-intro, and benefits sections; fix hero gradient banding; swap session-intro image from breathing-session.jpg to meditation-group.jpg for visual variety; tighten copy to be direct and confident.

Purpose: The user explicitly forbids em-dashes across the entire page. This plan eliminates every em-dash from three of the highest-visibility sections and fixes two visual issues (gradient banding, duplicate hero image).
Output: Three updated component files with zero em-dashes, a smooth gradient, and visual variety between hero and session-intro images.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Fix hero-section.tsx — remove em-dashes and smooth gradient</name>
  <files>src/components/intro/hero-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
Make two categories of changes to src/components/intro/hero-section.tsx:

**1. Remove em-dashes from bullet copy (lines 41-50).**

Current bullet 1 (line 41):
```
<span><strong className="text-white">SKY Breath Meditation</strong> — science-backed, used by 500M+</span>
```
Replace with (use a colon, no em-dash):
```
<span><strong className="text-white">SKY Breath Meditation</strong>: science-backed, used by 500M+</span>
```

Current bullet 3 (line 49):
```
<span><strong className="text-white">Effortless meditation</strong> — zero experience needed</span>
```
Replace with (restructure naturally, no em-dash):
```
<span><strong className="text-white">Effortless meditation</strong>, even if you have never meditated before</span>
```

Current button text (line 65):
```
Save My Seat — It&apos;s Free
```
Replace with (no em-dash):
```
Save My Seat — It&apos;s Free
```
Wait: the button uses `&apos;` not a raw em-dash character. Check line 65 carefully. The gap description says line 65 has an em-dash in the button text `"Save My Seat — It's Free"`. Replace the `—` with a comma or reword. Use:
```
Save My Seat. It&apos;s Free.
```
Or more naturally: keep the button text as `Save My Seat` and move "It's Free" to the subtext below. Looking at the current file, line 65 is inside a `<Button>` element. Change the button text to:
```
Save My Seat — It&apos;s Free
```
No — the `—` IS the em-dash character (Unicode U+2014). Replace it entirely. Use:
```
Save My Seat (It&apos;s Free)
```

**2. Fix gradient banding (line 22).**

Current gradient:
```
className="absolute inset-0 z-10 bg-gradient-to-b from-black/60 via-black/40 to-black/70"
```
The `via-black/40` dip creates a visible light band in the center. Replace with a smooth progression:
```
className="absolute inset-0 z-10 bg-gradient-to-b from-black/70 via-black/50 to-black/60"
```

After changes, verify no em-dash character (U+2014: `—`) exists anywhere in the file.

  <name>Task 2: Fix session-intro-section.tsx — remove em-dashes, swap image, tighten copy</name>
  <files>src/components/intro/session-intro-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
Make three categories of changes to src/components/intro/session-intro-section.tsx:

**1. Remove em-dashes from sessionPoints array (lines 4-9).**

Current sessionPoints[0] (line 5):
```
"A guided SKY Breath Meditation — the technique used by 500M+ people worldwide",
```
Replace with:
```
"A guided SKY Breath Meditation, the technique used by 500M+ people worldwide",
```

Current sessionPoints[1] (line 6):
```
"Practical tools to calm your nervous system instantly — no experience needed",
```
Replace with:
```
"Practical tools to calm your nervous system instantly. No experience needed.",
```

**2. Remove em-dash from the paragraph body text (line 39).**

Current paragraph:
```
In 60 minutes, you&apos;ll go from stressed and scattered to genuinely calm. No philosophy, no prior experience — just a breathing technique that actually works.
```
Replace with:
```
In 60 minutes, you&apos;ll go from stressed and scattered to genuinely calm. No philosophy, no prior experience. Just a breathing technique that actually works.
```

**3. Swap the image from breathing-session.jpg to meditation-group.jpg (line 19).**

Current:
```
src="/images/intro/breathing-session.jpg"
alt="Participants in a guided breathing session"
```
Replace with:
```
src="/images/intro/meditation-group.jpg"
alt="Group in a guided Art of Living meditation session"
```

After all changes, verify no em-dash character (U+2014) exists anywhere in the file and the image path is meditation-group.jpg.

  </verify>
  <done>session-intro-section.tsx has zero em-dashes; image is meditation-group.jpg (not breathing-session.jpg); paragraph copy ends with a period not an em-dash clause.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Fix benefits-section.tsx — remove em-dashes from descriptions and CTA button</name>
  <files>src/components/intro/benefits-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
Remove all em-dashes from src/components/intro/benefits-section.tsx:

**1. Fix benefits[0].description (line 9).**

Current:
```
description: "Science-backed technique validated by Yale & Harvard — feel the shift in a single session",
```
Replace with (split into two strong sentences):
```
description: "Science-backed technique validated by Yale and Harvard. Feel the shift in a single session.",
```

**2. Fix benefits[1].description (line 15).**

Current:
```
description: "Calms the nervous system and restores natural energy — no years of training required",
```
Replace with:
```
description: "Calms the nervous system and restores natural energy. No years of training required.",
```

**3. Fix the CTA button text (line 68).**

Current:
```
Save My Seat — It&apos;s Free
```
Replace with (matching the hero button fix, no em-dash):
```
Save My Seat (It&apos;s Free)
```

After changes, verify no em-dash character exists in the file. TypeScript compile must pass.

After all three tasks complete, run:
```bash
cd "/Users/mac/Documents/Art of Living Landing Page"
grep -rn "—" src/components/intro/hero-section.tsx src/components/intro/session-intro-section.tsx src/components/intro/benefits-section.tsx
npx tsc --noEmit
```
Both commands must return zero output (zero em-dashes, zero TypeScript errors).

Also confirm:
- src/components/intro/session-intro-section.tsx references meditation-group.jpg (not breathing-session.jpg)
- src/components/intro/hero-section.tsx gradient is `from-black/70 via-black/50 to-black/60`
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Zero em-dash characters in hero-section.tsx, session-intro-section.tsx, benefits-section.tsx
- session-intro-section.tsx uses meditation-group.jpg (distinct from hero background)
- Hero gradient is from-black/70 via-black/50 to-black/60 (no dip to 40% in middle)
- TypeScript compiles with zero errors after all changes
- All copy replacements use commas, periods, colons, or parentheses — never another em-dash
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-intro-talk-landing-page-trust-content/03-09-SUMMARY.md`
