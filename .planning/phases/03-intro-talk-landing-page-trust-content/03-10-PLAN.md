<objective>
Fix teacher quote attribution (double-hyphen), eliminate registration form dual-heading redundancy, replace the WhatToExpect cramped image header with a clean text heading, and remove the remaining em-dashes from about-section, testimonials-section, and objections-section CTA buttons.

Purpose: The user wants the page to look polished and not clunky. This plan resolves the structural layout issues (registration redundant headings, cramped image banner in WhatToExpect) and completes em-dash removal across all remaining components.
Output: Six updated component files with zero em-dashes, a single clean registration heading, and a visually consistent WhatToExpect header.

**teacher-section.tsx — fix double-hyphen attribution (line 57):**

Current:
```tsx
<cite className="text-xs text-primary/70 not-italic font-medium">
  -- Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar
</cite>
```
Replace `--` with no dash at all. Use an en-dash or just the name with an attribution label. The cleanest approach for a blockquote citation is to use a visually subtle label:
```tsx
<cite className="text-xs text-primary/70 not-italic font-medium">
  Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar
</cite>
```
No dash prefix. The `<cite>` element semantically marks it as a citation, so no punctuation prefix is needed.

**testimonials-section.tsx — fix CTA button em-dash (line 73):**

Current:
```tsx
Save My Seat — It&apos;s Free
```
Replace with (consistent with hero and benefits fix):
```tsx
Save My Seat (It&apos;s Free)
```

**objections-section.tsx — fix CTA button em-dash (line 64):**

Current:
```tsx
Save My Seat — It&apos;s Free
```
Replace with:
```tsx
Save My Seat (It&apos;s Free)
```

After all changes, verify zero em-dashes in all three files.

**registration-form.tsx — merge duplicate headings (Gap C):**

Currently there are two headings stacked back-to-back:
1. Section heading: "Ready to Experience It?" (h2, outside the Card)
2. CardTitle: "Reserve Your Free Seat" (inside CardHeader)

This creates visual clutter. Remove the outer section heading entirely (remove the `<div className="text-center mb-6">` block containing the h2 "Ready to Experience It?" and the paragraph "Join your free 60-minute session").

Keep the social proof trust badge div (the avatar cluster) as the section opener.

Update the CardTitle to be warmer and serve as the sole section heading. Change it from:
```tsx
<CardTitle className="text-xl sm:text-2xl text-center">
  Reserve Your Free Seat
</CardTitle>
```
To:
```tsx
<CardTitle className="text-xl sm:text-2xl text-center">
  Reserve Your Free Seat
</CardTitle>
```
Keep the CardTitle text as-is. Just remove the redundant outer h2 section.

The section structure should become:
1. Social proof avatar cluster (stays)
2. Card with CardHeader showing just "Reserve Your Free Seat" (one clear heading)
3. Form fields inside CardContent (unchanged)

Do NOT remove CardHeader or CardTitle. Do NOT alter form fields, GDPR checkbox, or submit button.

**about-section.tsx — remove em-dash (line 29):**

Current paragraph (line 29):
```tsx
Today we operate in 180 countries and have touched 500 million lives — through direct teaching and the genuine transformation people experience. Every local session is run by a volunteer certified teacher.
```
Replace with (split the clause naturally, no em-dash):
```tsx
Today we operate in 180 countries and have touched 500 million lives through direct teaching and genuine personal transformation. Every local session is run by a volunteer certified teacher.
```

After changes, verify no em-dash in about-section.tsx and registration-form.tsx has only one heading (CardTitle inside Card, no outer h2).

  <name>Task 3: Replace WhatToExpectSection cramped image header with clean decorative accent header</name>
  <files>src/components/intro/what-to-expect-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
The current WhatToExpectSection uses a short (h-40 sm:h-48) image banner with text overlay as the section header. This looks cramped and the text is barely readable against the image. Remove the image banner entirely and replace with a clean centered text heading using the same decorative accent bar pattern used by TestimonialsSection and TeacherSection.

**Remove this entire block** (currently lines 29-44, the image header):
```tsx
<div className="relative rounded-2xl overflow-hidden mb-6 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
  <Image
    src="/images/intro/breathing-session.jpg"
    alt="Group breathing and meditation session"
    width={1200}
    height={400}
    className="w-full h-40 sm:h-48 object-cover"
    priority={false}
  />
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-t from-muted/90 via-muted/40 to-transparent" />
  <div className="absolute bottom-4 left-0 right-0">
    <h2 className="text-xl font-bold tracking-tight sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl text-foreground">
      What to Expect in 60 Minutes
    </h2>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Replace with this clean header** (matching TestimonialsSection's decorative accent bar style):
```tsx
<div className="inline-block w-12 h-1 rounded-full bg-primary mb-4" />
<h2 className="text-xl font-bold tracking-tight sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-2">
  What to Expect in 60 Minutes
</h2>
```

Keep the existing subtitle paragraph below unchanged:
```tsx
<p className="text-muted-foreground text-base sm:text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto">
  A guided journey from understanding your mind to experiencing deep
  inner calm
</p>
```

After removing the image block, also check if the `Image` import from `next/image` is still used elsewhere in the file. If no other `<Image>` tags remain in the file, remove the `import Image from "next/image"` line entirely to prevent an unused import TypeScript warning.

TypeScript compile must pass after this change.

    <manual>npx tsc must produce zero output. grep count must be 0 (image banner removed). The file must still contain the h2 "What to Expect in 60 Minutes" and the decorative "inline-block w-12 h-1 rounded-full bg-primary" accent bar.</manual>

  <done>WhatToExpectSection no longer renders a cramped image banner.

After all three tasks complete, run:
```bash
cd "/Users/mac/Documents/Art of Living Landing Page"
grep -rn "—" src/components/intro/
npx tsc --noEmit
```

First command must return zero lines (no em-dashes across all intro components).
Second command must return zero output (zero TypeScript errors).

Also verify:
- teacher-section.tsx: no `--` prefix before Gurudev name
- registration-form.tsx: "Ready to Experience It?" does not appear; "Reserve Your Free Seat" appears once in CardTitle
- what-to-expect-section.tsx: no `h-40` or `breathing-session.jpg` reference; has decorative accent bar
- about-section.tsx: no `—` character

<success_criteria>
- Zero em-dash characters across all six modified component files
- Teacher section cite has no double-hyphen or dash prefix
- Registration form has one heading ("Reserve Your Free Seat" in CardTitle) — outer "Ready to Experience It?" section removed
- WhatToExpectSection uses a clean `inline-block w-12 h-1 bg-primary` accent bar above the heading, not a cramped image banner
- AboutSection body paragraph has no em-dash
- TypeScript compiles with zero errors after all changes
