<objective>
Transform the Hero and Benefits sections from generic text-on-white into visually arresting, premium experiences that convert cold Facebook ad traffic.

Purpose: The hero is the first impression after a Facebook ad click — if it looks like a template, visitors bounce. The benefits section is where visitors decide if the event is worth their time — plain checkmarks signal "generic webinar", not a transformative experience.

Output: A hero section with background image + gradient overlay that creates dramatic visual impact, and a benefits section with icon cards that feel premium and trustworthy.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Hero section — full-width background image with gradient overlay</name>
  <files>src/components/intro/hero-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
Rewrite `HeroSection` to use `breathing-session.jpg` (already at `public/images/intro/breathing-session.jpg`, 1200x600px) as a full-width background image with a dark gradient overlay, creating a dramatic, premium first impression.

**Layout approach:**
- Outer `<section>` becomes `relative overflow-hidden` with `min-h-[60vh] sm:min-h-[70vh]` and `flex items-center`
- Use a `next/image` component with `fill` prop and `className="object-cover"` as the background layer — wrap it in an absolutely positioned container: `<div className="absolute inset-0 z-0">` containing `<Image src="/images/intro/breathing-session.jpg" alt="" fill className="object-cover" priority />`
- Dark gradient overlay on top of image: `<div className="absolute inset-0 z-10 bg-gradient-to-b from-black/60 via-black/40 to-black/70" />`
- Content div: `relative z-20 max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 py-16 sm:py-24 text-center`
- All text inside content becomes white: Badge gets `bg-white/20 text-white border-white/30 backdrop-blur-sm`, h1 becomes `text-white` with the span highlight becoming `text-primary` (still orange — pops against dark background), p becomes `text-white/85`, Clock icon and date text become `text-white/90`

**CTA with urgency (Gap 9 for hero):**
- Replace plain "Save My Seat — It's Free" Button with a visually distinct version:
  - Button classes: `w-full sm:w-auto h-14 text-lg font-semibold px-8 shadow-lg shadow-primary/30 hover:shadow-primary/50 transition-shadow`
  - Add urgency sub-text below the button: `<p className="mt-3 text-sm text-white/70">Free • No credit card • Spots limited</p>`
  - Keep `href="#register"` wrapping link

**Keep all existing content** (Badge "Free Online Event", h1 text, p text, Clock + date/time display, button link to #register). Only change visual treatment, not content.

**Note:** `next/image` with `fill` requires a positioned parent. The `relative overflow-hidden` on section provides this.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Benefits section — icon cards with visual richness</name>
  <files>src/components/intro/benefits-section.tsx</files>
  <action>
Rewrite `BenefitsSection` to replace the plain `CheckCircle + text` 2-column grid with rich icon cards — each benefit in its own card with a large meaningful icon, a short title, and a brief description.

**Restructure the benefits data** from a flat string array to an array of objects:
```typescript
const benefits = [
  {
    icon: Wind,        // from lucide-react — represents breath/SKY
    title: "SKY Breath Meditation",
    description: "A powerful technique backed by Yale and Harvard research — calm your mind in minutes",
  },
  {
    icon: Moon,        // sleep/rest
    title: "Better Sleep & Energy",
    description: "Simple practices that reduce stress, deepen sleep, and restore natural vitality",
  },
  {
    icon: Users,       // community
    title: "Welcoming Community",
    description: "Connect with like-minded people in Devon & Southwest on the same journey",
  },
  {
    icon: GraduationCap,  // teacher/learning
    title: "Expert Guidance",
    description: "Guided by an experienced, certified Art of Living teacher in every session",
  },
]
```

**Card layout:**
- Grid: `grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4 sm:gap-6 mb-8`
- Each card: use shadcn `Card` with `CardContent` — classes `h-full p-6 border-0 shadow-sm bg-gradient-to-br from-background to-primary/5 hover:shadow-md transition-shadow`
- Inside card:
  - Icon container: `<div className="h-12 w-12 rounded-xl bg-primary/10 flex items-center justify-center mb-4">` with `<Icon className="h-6 w-6 text-primary" />`
  - Title: `<h3 className="font-semibold text-base sm:text-lg mb-2">{benefit.title}</h3>`
  - Description: `<p className="text-sm sm:text-base text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">{benefit.description}</p>`

**CTA differentiation (Gap 9 for benefits — secondary variant):**
- Change the CTA Button variant to `variant="outline"` with additional classes: `border-primary text-primary hover:bg-primary hover:text-primary-foreground w-full sm:w-auto h-14 text-lg font-semibold px-8`
- Keep the text "Save My Seat — It's Free" and `href="#register"` link

**Imports to add:** `Wind, Moon, Users, GraduationCap` from `lucide-react`; `Card, CardContent` from `@/components/ui/card`
**Import to remove:** `CheckCircle` from `lucide-react` (no longer needed)

Keep the section heading "What You'll Experience" and the `bg-muted/50` section background.

After both tasks complete:
1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` in project root — must exit zero with no errors
2. Run `npm run build` — must complete without errors
3. Open `/intro` in browser:
   - Hero: full-width background image visible, dark overlay, all text white and readable, urgency sub-text below CTA
   - Benefits: 4 icon cards in 2-column grid, each with icon circle, title, description, gradient card background
   - Hero CTA (solid primary) and Benefits CTA (outline style) are visually distinct from each other
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Hero section: `relative overflow-hidden` wrapper, `next/image` with `fill` for background, gradient overlay div, all text white, urgency sub-text present
- Benefits section: 4 benefit objects with `icon`, `title`, `description` fields; Card components with gradient backgrounds; icon containers with `bg-primary/10`; outline CTA button
- Zero TypeScript errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` passes)
- Zero build errors (`npm run build` passes)
- Gaps 6, 7, and 9 (hero+benefits CTAs) are closed
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-intro-talk-landing-page-trust-content/03-05-SUMMARY.md`
