<objective>
Build the trust-building data layer and two key visual sections — testimonials and credibility stats — for the intro talk landing page. These replace the placeholder SocialProofSection with rich, visually prominent content designed to convince cold Facebook ad traffic that Art of Living is a credible, global organization.

Purpose: Cold traffic from Facebook ads has zero brand awareness. Credibility stats and real testimonials are the fastest trust signals that convert skeptics into registrants.
Output: Two new section components with typed data files, and the old placeholder SocialProofSection removed or emptied.

  <name>Task 1: Create testimonial and credibility data files + testimonials section component</name>

    src/lib/data/testimonials.ts
    src/lib/data/credibility-stats.ts
    src/components/intro/testimonials-section.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**Data files:**

1. Create `src/lib/data/testimonials.ts`:
   - Export a `Testimonial` type: `{ name: string; quote: string; highlight?: string; context?: string }`
   - Export a `testimonials` array with 5-6 real testimonials from the RESEARCH.md findings:
     - Charlotte P. (Lawyer) — "I have been looking for this for 15 years! The techniques are truly a gift."
     - Phillip M. (Stress management) — "About 30 days after practicing regularly, I got so happy for no reason."
     - Sonia K. (Parent) — "SKY has made all the difference in better communicating with family."
     - Rebecca D. (Professional) — "People who are so busy definitely need it the most."
     - Neeva P. (Mental clarity) — "After I did the course, I just felt so calm inside."
     - Optional 6th: Luis Gagnon (CEO) — "It changed my life literally overnight."
   - Include `highlight` field for short pull-quotes (the most impactful phrase from each quote)

2. Create `src/lib/data/credibility-stats.ts`:
   - Export a `CredibilityStat` type: `{ icon: string; number: string; label: string }`
   - Export a `credibilityStats` array with 4 stats:
     - Users icon, "500M+", "Lives touched worldwide" (using user's preferred number from CONTEXT.md)
     - Globe icon, "180+", "Countries" (user's preferred number)
     - BookOpen icon, "100+", "Peer-reviewed studies"
     - GraduationCap icon, "Yale & Harvard", "Research-backed"
   - Export a `researchHighlights` array with 2-3 brief research citations:
     - Yale study (2020): SKY program most effective for student wellbeing
     - Harvard Medical School: Independent research endorsing SKY Breath

**Testimonials section component:**

3. Create `src/components/intro/testimonials-section.tsx`:
   - Import `testimonials` from data file
   - Import `Quote` icon from lucide-react
   - Import `Card`, `CardContent` from shadcn/ui
   - Section heading: "What People Are Saying" or similar
   - Render testimonials as cards in a responsive grid: 1 column on mobile, 2 columns on `md:` breakpoint
   - Each card shows: Quote icon (text-primary/30), quote text with curly quotes, name + context below
   - Use avatar initial circle (bg-primary/10 with first letter) for human touch
   - Follow existing section spacing pattern: `px-4 py-12 sm:px-6 sm:py-16 lg:py-20`
   - Container: `max-w-4xl mx-auto`
   - Include a CTA button after testimonials: "Save My Seat — It's Free" linking to #register
   - Visually rich: use Card shadow, generous padding, quote icon prominence
   - Mobile-first: cards stack vertically on mobile, no cramped grid

  <name>Task 2: Create credibility section component and remove old SocialProofSection placeholder</name>
  <files>
    src/components/intro/credibility-section.tsx
    src/components/intro/social-proof-section.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
**Credibility section:**

1. Create `src/components/intro/credibility-section.tsx`:
   - Import stats from `@/lib/data/credibility-stats.ts`
   - Import icons from lucide-react: `Users`, `Globe`, `BookOpen`, `GraduationCap`, `FlaskConical` (or similar for research)
   - Section heading: "Backed by Science, Embraced by Millions" or similar trust-building headline
   - **Stats grid:** 4 stats in a 2x2 grid on mobile, 4 columns on `sm:` breakpoint
     - Each stat: icon above (h-8 w-8 text-primary), large bold number below (`text-3xl sm:text-4xl font-bold text-primary`), small label text underneath
     - Subtle card or bg treatment for each stat cell
   - **Research highlights:** Below stats, show 2-3 research citations as compact badges or cards
     - Each shows institution name (Yale, Harvard) and brief finding
     - Use `Badge` component or small cards with institution icon/shield
   - Use alternating background: `bg-muted/50` for visual rhythm with surrounding sections
   - Follow existing section spacing: `px-4 py-12 sm:px-6 sm:py-16 lg:py-20`, `max-w-4xl mx-auto`
   - Include CTA button after section: "Save My Seat — It's Free" linking to #register
   - Visually prominent: stats must draw the eye — NOT blend into surrounding text. Large numbers, color accent, icon treatment

**Remove old placeholder:**

2. Update `src/components/intro/social-proof-section.tsx`:
   - Either delete the file entirely, OR gut it to just re-export `CredibilitySection` for backwards compatibility
   - The old placeholder stats (180+, Millions, 50+) are being superseded by the richer CredibilitySection
   - Recommendation: keep the file but have it re-export CredibilitySection so page.tsx import still works until Plan 02 updates page.tsx composition. E.g.: `export { CredibilitySection as SocialProofSection } from "./credibility-section"`
